Analyzing the sensitivity of the Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX) to axion-like particles.

* Analyzed the kinematics of ALP decay
* Looked at the reconstruction of the ALPs and decay products in the HCAL
* Training and testing a boosted decision tree to discriminate ALP decay products from a photo-nuclear background


Note: Some of the config and reconstruction files were mainly written by my mentor Sophie Middleton, which I modified.
